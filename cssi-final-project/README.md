## A Language & Vocabulary Learning Game

Mr. Worldwide: The Snowman is a children's word-guessing game for vocabulary 
and language learning. 

Players can choose from English, French, Spanish or Russian at 3 difficulty levels, and guess letters by typing on their keyboards.

For foreign languages, players must change their keyboard language to type accented characters and use different alphabets.

Correct letters appear above the corresponding blanks, while wrong letters are displayed on the left and cause the snowman to slowly melt away.

For a hint, or to learn the word's pronunciation, players can click the sound icon on the upper left corner the hear the word spoken aloud.

This was created as a final project for the Google CSSI: Online Summer Program 2020 for incoming college students.
